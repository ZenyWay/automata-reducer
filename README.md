# automata-reducer
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/automata-reducer.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/automata-reducer/)

a tiny (390 bytes) simple finite-state-machine that switches reducers.
no dependencies.

# example
see this example in [this directory](./example/index.ts).<br/>
run this example [in your browser](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ZenyWay/automata-reducer/v2.0.1/example/index.html).

```ts
import createAutomataReducer, { AutomataSpec, StandardAction } from '../'
import { propCursor } from 'basic-cursors'
import actions from './actions'
import log from './console'

interface State {
  state: string
  value: number
}

const inValue = propCursor('value')

const automata: AutomataSpec<State> = {
  'init': {
    IDLE: 'idle',
    INCREMENT: [inValue(increment), 'idle']
  },
  'idle': {
    RESET: ['init', inValue(reset)],
    INCREMENT: inValue(increment)
  }
}

function increment (value: number = 0, { payload }: StandardAction<number>): number {
  return !payload ? value : value + payload
}

function reset (): number {
  return 0
}

const reducer = createAutomataReducer(automata, 'init')

const idle = reducer(void 0, actions.IDLE())
log('IDLE():')(idle) // IDLE(): {"state":"idle"}
const fourtytwo = reducer(idle, actions.INCREMENT(42))
log('INCREMENT(42):')(fourtytwo) // INCREMENT(42): {"state":"idle","value":42}
const init = reducer(fourtytwo, actions.RESET())
log('RESET():')(init) // RESET(): {"state":"init","value":0}
```

# API
as demonstrated in the above example, for each automata state,
the automata spec defines a single reducer or a list of reducers
for each action (or event) relevant to that state.
* a string is replaced by a reducer of the automata's state
that sets the latter to that string.
* reducers listed in an array are executed sequentially, from right to left
(last to first).

when combined with a `propCursor` from the
[`basic-cursors`](https://npmjs.com/package/basic-cursors) module
which applies a reducer to a named property of the state object,
and only updates the state if the reducer returns a different value,
reducers can be minimized to very simple functions,
resulting in a self-documenting the automata spec,
such as in the above example.

```ts
export default function createAutomataReducer
  <S extends object, A = StandardAction<any>>(
    automata: AutomataSpec<S, A>,
    init: string,
    toStandardAction?: ActionStandardizer
  ): Reducer<S, A>
export default function createAutomataReducer
  <S extends object, A = StandardAction<any>>(
    automata: AutomataSpec<S, A>,
    init: string,
    key: string, // optional: custom key for the automata state (default: 'state')
    toStandardAction?: ActionStandardizer
  ): Reducer<S, A>

export interface AutomataSpec<S, A = StandardAction<any>> {
  [state: string]: {
    [type: string]: (Reducer<Partial<S>, A> | string)[] | (Reducer<Partial<S>, A> | string)
  }
}

export interface StandardAction<P> {
  type: string
  payload?: P
}

export declare type Reducer<S, A = StandardAction<any>> =
  (state: S, action: A) => S

export declare type ActionStandardizer = <A, P>(action: A) => StandardAction<P>
```

# TypeScript
although this library is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org),
it may also be imported into plain JavaScript code:
modern code editors will still benefit from the available type definition,
e.g. for helpful code completion.
